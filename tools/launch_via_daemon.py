"""Ask whisplay-daemon to launch the app, and let it own the process.

Used at boot instead of a systemd service that runs the app directly.

The daemon ties foreground focus to the process **it** spawned:

    if app.process is not None and app.process.poll() is not None:
        if self.foreground_app_id == app.app_id:
            self._release_focus(app, "process_exit")

So an app started by systemd is invisible to it. Selecting the app on
the desktop makes the daemon spawn a second copy; that copy finds the
single-instance lock held and exits, and the daemon reads its exit as
the app quitting and revokes focus -- the screen flicks to the app and
straight back to the desktop, every time. The app looks like it will not
open.

Launching through the daemon avoids all of it. The daemon owns the
process, `app.list` reports it running, and because four clicks now
backgrounds rather than exits, that one process keeps listening for the
rest of the session -- which is what "always standby" needed anyway.
