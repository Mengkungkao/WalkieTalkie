"""Is the module actually able to hear the air?

The SX126X decides what it is doing from two pins, M0 and M1:

    M0=0 M1=0   transparent -- transmits and receives
    M0=1 M1=0   wake-on-radio transmit
    M0=0 M1=1   configuration -- deaf to the air
    M0=1 M1=1   sleep -- deaf to the air

On this hardware those are GPIO 22 and 27, which are also two of the
Whisplay LCD's control lines. With the HAT's M0/M1 jumpers fitted, the
display driver decides what mode the radio is in, and it parks them
high -- so the module sits in sleep, silently. Everything above the
radio keeps working: the app records, encodes, fragments and writes to
the UART, and the log cheerfully says "sent 7 packets". Nothing goes on
the air, and nothing is received, and there is no error anywhere.

That is a bad failure to leave invisible, so the app checks and says so.

**Reading these pins is the trap.** `RPi.GPIO.setup(pin, IN)`
reconfigures the pad to an input before reading it, which both destroys
the value being measured and knocks the module out of transparent mode
if it happened to be in it. This reads the SoC's level and function
registers straight out of /dev/gpiomem instead, touching nothing.
