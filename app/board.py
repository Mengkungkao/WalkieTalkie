"""Getting hold of the Whisplay hardware.

Under `whisplay-daemon` the app never touches SPI or GPIO: the daemon
owns the LCD, the RGB LED, the backlight and the button, and hands out a
shared framebuffer plus an event stream. That separation is what makes
the LoRa HAT workable at all here -- the daemon is already driving GPIO
22 and 27 for the display, which are the same pins the SX126X uses for
M0/M1, so an app that grabbed GPIO directly would fight the screen.

`exit_gesture` is "none" on purpose. The daemon's default is four clicks
inside a 3-second window, and this app uses single clicks to step
through contacts and inbox items -- a user moving briskly down a list
produces four clicks in three seconds routinely and would be killed
mid-transmission. With "none" the app owns every gesture and handles
exit itself, using the much tighter 700 ms click window.

    This exists because of a gap in `whisplay_client`. When the user
    returns to an app that is still running, the daemon does not wait to
    be asked: `_launch_app` sees the process alive, calls `_grant_focus`
    itself -- which mints a **new session token and reallocates the
    framebuffer** -- and broadcasts `app_foreground_acquired`. The
    client's event loop handles `button_pressed`, `button_released`,
    `app_exit_requested` and `app_focus_revoked`, and silently drops
    that one.

    The app is then left holding a torn-down mmap and a stale token
    while the daemon, believing the app is foreground, stops drawing the
    desktop. Nobody paints anything: the screen goes black and stays
    black until the app is killed.

    Two traps, both hit while fixing this:

    * **Do not poll `acquire_foreground`.** After a back gesture the app
      is still running with the desktop showing, and a retry loop would
      snatch the screen from the user every few seconds.
    * **Do not call `acquire_foreground` from this handler.** It sends
      `app.focus.acquire`, the daemon answers by granting focus, and
      granting focus broadcasts `app_foreground_acquired` -- straight
      back into this handler, forever. The session token arrives in the
      event payload, so adopt that and ask only for the framebuffer;
      `framebuffer.acquire` broadcasts nothing. A token we already hold
      is our own grant echoing back and is ignored.
