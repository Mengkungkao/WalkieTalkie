"""One radio, one process.

Two copies of this app running at once is not merely wasteful, it is
actively destructive: each asks the daemon for the foreground, every
grant revokes the other one's session, and the two ping-pong focus
between themselves several times a second. The screen thrashes, both
processes burn a core, and neither ever settles -- observed at 98% CPU
and 24 focus grants per second.

They would also both hold /dev/ttyS0 and interleave bytes into the same
LoRa module, which corrupts every frame in both directions.

An `flock` on a file in the data directory is enough. It is released
automatically when the process dies, however it dies, so a crashed or
SIGKILLed instance never leaves a stale lock behind -- which a PID file
would.
