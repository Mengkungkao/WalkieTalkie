"""Push-to-talk recording, with a pre-roll so the first word survives.

The naive design -- spawn `arecord` when the button passes the hold
threshold -- loses the beginning of every transmission. Measured on both
Pis, the WM8960 needs **~690 ms** to power up its ADC and deliver a
first sample, and that cost is paid on every cold open regardless of
rate, channel count, or whether ALSA's plug layer is involved:

    plughw 8000 mono      702 ms      hw 48000 stereo       686 ms
    plughw 48000 stereo   678 ms      fork+exec alone         9 ms

On top of the 350 ms hold threshold, that is over a second of dead air.
Presses shorter than that captured *nothing*, which surfaced in the logs
as `recorded 0.00s (0 B PCM)` and, to the operator, as a radio that
silently refused to send.

The same measurement shows the way out: opening a second capture while
one is already running takes **15 ms**. The delay is the codec powering
up, not the open itself. So the recorder keeps one `arecord` running
while armed, feeding a small ring buffer, and PTT simply marks a
position in it. Latency becomes negligible, and the ring means the
audio from *before* the hold threshold is kept too -- so a user who
starts talking as they press still gets their first syllable.

Power is the reason this is armed rather than permanent. A warm codec
costs current continuously, which is exactly what a belt-worn radio
cannot afford. Arming follows the screen: awake means in use and PTT is
instant, and when the backlight blanks the capture stream is dropped and
the codec powers down. `start()` still works when disarmed, falling back
to a cold spawn, so nothing depends on the arming being right.
